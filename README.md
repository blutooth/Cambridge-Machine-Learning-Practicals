# Cambridge-Machine-Learning-Practicals
Subset of machine Learning practical Experiments at Cambridge - In order of what I found most interesting

  - RL submit: (https://github.com/blutooth/Cambridge-Machine-Learning-Practicals/blob/master/RL%20submit.pdf)  Reinforcement Learning techniques for navigating around a room with obstacles
  
  - final Report Signed: Global optimisation methods, exploring Simulated Annealing and Evolutionary Strategies,  code in 'global_optimisation_code.pdf'  (https://github.com/blutooth/Cambridge-Machine-Learning-Practicals/blob/master/golbal_optimisation_code.pdf), (https://github.com/blutooth/Cambridge-Machine-Learning-Practicals/blob/master/golbal_optimisation_code.pdf)
  
  - opt1: Gradient based optimisation Techniques (https://github.com/blutooth/Cambridge-Machine-Learning-Practicals/blob/master/opt1.pdf
  
  - sruf: Gaussian Process Regression with Different kernels
